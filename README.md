In this data science project I implemented several data science techniques in order to obtain the most relevant patterns that induce to childhood obesity. Some techniques used are:
- Regression based imputation of missing values.
- Data discretization.
- Data mining DeFme algorithm, to mine all the generator frequent itemsets with *sup>0.3*.
- Feature selection via *minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance* (*mRMR) algorithm.
- Evaluate the discriminative power of these patterns using a *Decision Tree Classifier* implementing several approaches, including *Leave One Out per Class CV*, *K-Fold CV* and hybrid-data model based approach.
